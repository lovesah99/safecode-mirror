/// PageSize - Contains the size of the unit of memory allocated by

// The lower and upper bound of an unmapped memory region.  This range is used
// for rewriting pointers that go one beyond the edge of an object so that they
// can be used for comparisons but will generate a fault if used for loads or
// stores.
//
// There are a few restrictions:
//  1) I *think* InvalidUpper must be on a page boundary.
//  2) None of the values can be reserved pointer values.  Such values include:
//      0 - This is the NULL pointer.
//      1 - This is a reserved pointer in the Linux kernel.
//      2 - This is another reserved pointer in the Linux kernel.
//
// Here's the breakdown of how it works on various operating systems:
//  o) Linux           - We use the kernel's reserved address space (which is
//                       inaccessible from applications).
//  o) Other platforms - We use the first page of memory which is typically
//                       unmapped.
